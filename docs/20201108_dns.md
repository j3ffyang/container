## Objective

Never thought I'd again install and configure DNS. Read several references on web. Here I come.

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

## Install and Configure

#### IPv4 only

```sh
cat /etc/default/named
#
# run resolvconf?
RESOLVCONF=no

# startup options for the server
OPTIONS="-4 -u bind"
# "-4" is to disable IPv6
```

#### `/etc/bind/named.conf.options` for all outside query

```sh
acl "trusted" {
	172.16.51.99;	# ns1
};

options {
	directory "/var/cache/bind";

	// If there is a firewall between you and nameservers you want
	// to talk to, you may need to fix the firewall to allow multiple
	// ports to talk.  See http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113

	// If your ISP provided one or more IP addresses for stable
	// nameservers, you probably want to use them as forwarders.  
	// Uncomment the following block, and insert the addresses replacing
	// the all-0's placeholder.

	recursion yes;                 # enables resursive queries
	allow-recursion { trusted; };  # allows recursive queries from "trusted" clients
	listen-on { 172.16.51.99; };   # ns1 private IP address - listen on private network only
	allow-transfer { none; };      # disable zone transfers by default

	forwarders {
		208.67.222.222;
		208.67.220.220;
                # 8.8.8.8;
                # 8.8.4.4;
	};
...
```

Where `172.16.51.99` is `localhost` and DNS server self, and `208.67.222.222` & `208.67.220.220` are openDNS as parent DNS

#### `/etc/bind/named.conf.local` for local query

```sh
zone "example.com" {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
};
```

#### Create forward zone file

```sh
sudo cp /etc/bind/db.local /etc/bind/db.cptheat.com
cat /etc/bind/db.example.com

;
; BIND data file for local loopback interface
;
$TTL	604800
@	IN	SOA	cptheat.com. root.cptheat.com. (
			      2		; Serial
			 604800		; Refresh
			  86400		; Retry
			2419200		; Expire
			 604800 )	; Negative Cache TTL
;
@	IN	NS	ns.cptheat.com.
@	IN	A	172.16.51.99
@	IN	AAAA	::1
ns	IN	A	172.16.51.99
www	IN	CNAME	cptheat.com
```
