## Background

<!-- Used to write book with `gitbook`, then `honkit`, which are based on `nodejs`. Look for a better solution, all recommendations pointed me to `hugo`.

Searched for years

Glue the multiple steps together -->

For several years, I authored books using `GitBook` and `Honkit`, both of which are based on `Node.js`. In my quest for a more efficient solution, I discovered that all recommendations pointed me toward `Hugo`.

After writing a book and documents with `hugo`, I posted them on `github pages`, as DevOps process that automatically syncs the content to `github pages`.

Now, I have chosen to document my personal experiences and share them with the open-source community.

## Installing

<!-- Installing `hugo` is pretty straightforward. You can reference at https://gohugo.io/ > Getting Started > Quick Start. -->

Installing `Hugo` is quite simple. For detailed instructions, you can refer to the "Getting Started" section under "Quick Start" at gohugo.io.

## Selecting a Theme

I personally like the theme `relearn` from https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/. Not only does it provide the beautiful UI, but it also supports `plantuml`(https://plantuml.com) and `mermaid`, as I used to draw diagrams in my documents and book.

## Configuring and Starting to Write

The configuration of Hugo can vary depending on the theme you choose. Here I only document the configuration of `relearn` theme particularly for the book that I am writing, on **Linux**.
