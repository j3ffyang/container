# OpenSSL and Secrets in Kubernetes

#### Objective

Use `openssl` to manage `certificate` and `key` where are configured in `secrets` in Kubernetes cluster

#### Bundled Chain Certificate

- The bundled certificate contains certificate of hostSelf, intermediate and CAroot, 3 parts, chained in one single __chained__ `cert.pem`
- The correct order of bundled certificates is: hostSelf (top) > intermediate cert > CAroot cert (bottom)

#### `openssl crl2pkcs7` - Validate the chained certificates

```sh
user@debian:~/$ openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile chain.pem | openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -noout
subject=CN = sub.domain.com

issuer=C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = Sectigo Limited, CN = Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA


subject=C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = Sectigo Limited, CN = Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA

issuer=C = US, ST = New Jersey, L = Jersey City, O = The USERTRUST Network, CN = USERTrust RSA Certification Authority


subject=C = US, ST = New Jersey, L = Jersey City, O = The USERTRUST Network, CN = USERTrust RSA Certification Authority

issuer=C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = Comodo CA Limited, CN = AAA Certificate Services
```

#### `openssl x509 -dates` - Check certificate validated period

```sh
openssl x509 -dates -noout < /path/fullchain.pem
notBefore=Nov 14 08:49:01 2021 GMT
notAfter=Feb 12 08:49:00 2022 GMT
```

#### `openssl s_client` - Verify the deployed certificate in Nginx web-server in Kubernetes

```sh
user@debian:~$ openssl s_client -showcerts -connect 10.0.10.18:32160
CONNECTED(00000003)
Can't use SSL_get_servername
depth=2 C = US, ST = New Jersey, L = Jersey City, O = The USERTRUST Network, CN = USERTrust RSA Certification Authority
verify return:1
depth=1 C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = Sectigo Limited, CN = Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = sub.domain.com
verify return:1
---
Certificate chain
 0 s:CN = sub.domain.com
   i:C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = Sectigo Limited, CN = Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIGSTCCBTGgAwIBAgIQQ9ytVSnDH7HqTBzJ3ZYdxTANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCB
...
```

Where `10.0.10.18` is one of the worker node with `nginx-ingress-controller` deployed and `32160` is `nodePort` configured in `service/nginx-ingress-controller`

```sh
user@node1:~/$ kubectl -n shared get svc | grep nginx-ingress-controller
nginx-ingress-controller           NodePort    10.233.33.142   <none>        80:31500/TCP,443:32160/TCP   8d
```

The output of `openssl s_client -showcerts` should be _exactly_ the same as the above result from `openssl crl2pkcs7`
